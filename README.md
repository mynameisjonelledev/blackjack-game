## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by **Scrimba's Blackjack exercise project** and was created as part of my practice in frontend development. It has been a great way to enhance my understanding of JavaScript game logic, conditional statements, and DOM manipulation.

## Added Features

- Require player to enter their name before starting the game.
